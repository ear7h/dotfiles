# home

This repo contains my `home-manager` configuration files. It used to be my plain
dotfiles, and that can be found in the `legacy` branch.

## notes

* `:PlugInstall` needs to be run on first install and when new plugins are added
* vim gets manually configured bc I could not get vim\_configurable to compile
	with `+clipboard`
* `skhd` and `yabai` need to be isntalled through `brew`, the version available
	at time of writing had bugs on Big Sur and updating it was non-trivial
